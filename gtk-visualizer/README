                      OpenCog AtomSpace Visualizer
                      ----------------------------

Visualizes the contents of the opecog atomspace.


How to use this:
-- start a cogserver
-- load a bunch of atoms into it
-- start OpenCogAtomSpaceVisualizer
--  ??  I dunno, doesn't work for me, I get a "connection refused"


Known Bugs:
-----------
* broken atom_types.script handling. There are at least 5, or more,
  atom_types.sciript files in use; all should be loaded.  Better yet,
  don't use them at all; ask the atomspace about what types it knows.
