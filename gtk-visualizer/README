                      OpenCog AtomSpace Visualizer
                      ----------------------------

Visualizes the contents of the opencog atomspace.


How to use this:
-- start a cogserver
-- load a bunch of atoms into it
-- start OpenCogAtomSpaceVisualizer
--  ??  I dunno, doesn't work for me, I get a "connection refused"


Known Bugs:
-----------
* broken atom_types.script handling. There are at least 5, or more,
  atom_types.sciript files in use; all should be loaded.  Better yet,
  don't use them at all; ask the atomspace about what types it knows.
* UI fails to appear when using recent versions of the gtk+ library, due
  to passing 0 for the column width in all of the calls to gtk_grid_attach().
  Also, all UI elements are manually coded/positioned, making it difficult to
  maintain/enhance...should probably use Glade or QT designer, or similar
  GUI development tool.
* port number of the REST server is hard-coded to 17034. This should
  be a command-line parm or configurable option.
